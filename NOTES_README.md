I could not have find enough time to make the table and list structures visually and responsively better.
Before this case study, I had zero knowledge about LitElement, That's why I actually tried to learn while I started developing. Since it was written in pure JavaScript, I didn't have much trouble adapting.

Since I didn't know the popular and community accepted libraries used in LitElement, I usually had to search on the internet and ask AIs to help me. (Vaadin table etc...)

I have a React/Next project that serves almost the same purpose as this case study. It's a panel I prepared for the bank employees I work at to help them manage their work.

I would like to have a detailed conversation with you about both this case study and that project. Thank you so much for the effort you put into this case study. LitElement was a technology I was completely unfamiliar with. I learned something new from this case study.
